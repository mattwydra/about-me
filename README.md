# Matt Wydra's Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This landing page contains a collection of demos (progress can be found [here](https://github.com/mattwydra/about-me/issues/1) and [here](https://github.com/mattwydra/about-me/issues/2)) for my personal projects, including mini-games, Discord bots, and other software development endeavors. Feel free to explore, check out the code, or use them as inspiration for your own projects!

## Overview

### MiniGames Passion Project
This project is a collection of interactive web-based games that I’ve developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The mini-games range from simple puzzles to more complex interactive experiences. Ongoing improvements include integrating backend functionality using **Flask**, **MongoDB**, and **SQLite** for high-score tracking and game data persistence.

**Upcoming Features:**
- **Game Modifications**: Add more gameplay modes, settings, and difficulty adjustments.
- **User Accounts**: Implement user authentication and personalized game data.
- **Leaderboards**: Display global or game-specific high scores.
- **Sound & Music**: Incorporate sound effects and background music for a richer experience.

### Discord API Bots
I’ve also created several Discord bots, including my **Hopecore Bot**, which utilizes **Node.js** and **Canvas**. These bots are designed for different purposes, including managing community interactions, sending motivational quotes, and more.

**Upcoming Features:**
- **Enhanced Customization**: Allow users to configure more bot settings directly via Discord commands.
- **Additional Bots**: I plan to develop more bots in the future to help with various tasks like automation, moderation, and fun commands.
- **Improved Interaction**: Add more interactive and dynamic features to the existing bots, such as games or random trivia.

### Other Projects
- **MASC Development**: A large-scale security testing project I contributed to in a Scrum environment, utilizing Java for security applications.
- **Data Science Rasterization**: A project that analyzes population distribution patterns in Côte d'Ivoire through spatial data and rasterization techniques.
- **ROI Calculator**: A dynamic ROI calculator built using the Google Spreadsheets API.
